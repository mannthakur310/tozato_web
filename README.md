Full-Stack Web Application (React + Node.js)
This is a complete full-stack web application built with a modern technology stack. It features a responsive frontend created with React and a robust backend API powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application is configured for seamless deployment on Vercel.

Live Demo Link: https://gofood-one.vercel.app/

✨ Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Dynamic Data Handling: Fetches and displays data from the backend API.

Order Management: Functionality to view and manage user orders.

Responsive Design: A clean user interface that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Router, Bootstrap

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Deployment: Vercel

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later recommended)

npm

MongoDB or a MongoDB Atlas account for the database.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd my-app

Set up the Backend:

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file (copy from .env.example)
# You will need to create a file named .env and add the variables below

Your backend/.env file should look like this:

MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key_for_jwt"

MONGO_URI: Your connection string for your local or cloud MongoDB database.

JWT_SECRET: A long, random string used to sign authentication tokens.

# Start the backend development server
npm run dev

The backend server will be running on http://localhost:5000 (or the port you configure).

Set up the Frontend:

# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm start

The React application will open and run on http://localhost:3000.

🏗️ Project Structure
The project is organized as a monorepo with two main folders:

my-app/
├── backend/         # Contains the Node.js/Express API
│   ├── model/
│   ├── router/
│   ├── .env         # (Private) Environment variables
│   ├── db.js
│   └── index.js
├── frontend/        # Contains the React application
│   ├── public/
│   └── src/
├── .gitignore
├── vercel.json      # Vercel deployment configuration
└── README.md

🌐 Deployment
This application is configured for easy deployment on Vercel. The vercel.json file in the root directory handles the build process and routing for both the frontend and backend.

When you push your code to your connected Git repository, Vercel will automatically build and deploy the changes.

Important: Remember to add your environment variables (MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET) to your Vercel project's settings to ensure the deployed application can connect to the database and handle authentication.
